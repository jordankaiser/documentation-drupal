# Content Modeling

Content modeling is identifying and constructing the different building blocks and data that compose the information on you site.

## Content Types

A content type is a subtype of a content entity. When a user selects Content &gt; Add Content &gt; \[Content Name\] they are selecting a Content Type. What seems like might a common differentiator between content types is the functionality the Content Type is setup for. For example a Content Type of Blog would have pagination functionality built into it while a Content Type of Webpage would not.

Examples of typical Content Types a site might have:

* Blog Post
* Article
* Recipes
* Web Page

Basically a Content Type is a high level container of data.
