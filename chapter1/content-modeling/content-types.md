# Content Types

A content type is a subtype of a content entity. When a user selects Content &gt; Add Content &gt; \[Content Name\] they are selecting a Content Type. What seems like might a common differentiator between content types is the functionality the Content Type is setup for. For example a Content Type of Blog would have pagination functionality built into it while a Content Type of Webpage would not.

Examples of typical Content Types a site might have:

* Blog Post
* Article
* Recipes
* Web Page

Basically a Content Type is a high level container of data.

[**Paragraphs**](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs)** - A note on Content Types.** Content Types by default allow you setup a pre-defined selection of fields for the user to fill out. The fields can be required or optional but the user doesn't have the ability to add or remove the fields that where given.

A popular module, [Paragraphs](https://www.drupal.org/project/paragraphs), adjusts this functionality. The user will choose a Content Type as before but then, instead of being presented with a selection of fields, the user is presented with the ability to choose from a drop-down of different types of content. This allows the user to customize the types of data on a Content Type.
