# Field Types

The _admin &gt; content_ and _admin &gt; structure &gt; content_ are examples of by-products of the Field API \(Fields\). While the entity system and node modules are responsible for defining the content type it is the Field API that is responsible for defining the individual components that make each content type unique.

To see an example of Fields take a look at _Structure  &gt; Content types  &gt; Basic page_.
