# Fields

Fields are the building block of Drupals content modeling system. Fields are at their most simple at a form text field. Text entered into these fields are what Drupal uses to build the content for the site.

Entities allow for the attachment of fields to Entity Bundles \(commonly called Content Types\). So Fields attached to Entity Bundles are the basic building block of Drupal.
