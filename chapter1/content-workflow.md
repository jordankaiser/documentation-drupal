# Content Workflow

Content workflow are things like article being in draft then published. This can be used to set up a defined process for content creation on the site. For example you could have a user who can only create draft content and another user who can publish that drafted content once they've reviewed it. A state of the workflow can be Unpublished which would remove a previously published piece of content.
