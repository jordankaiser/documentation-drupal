# Extend Drupal with Modules

Modules extend the functionality of Drupal in order to add new features as well as alter existing functionality.

The three types of modules are:

**Core modules:** These are included with Drupal core and are shipped with the standard drupal installation. They are in _/core/modules/_.

**Contributed modules:** These are modules built by the community. The are typically in _/modules/contrib_.

**Custom modules:** Custom modules written for your project. Typically in _/modules/custom_.
