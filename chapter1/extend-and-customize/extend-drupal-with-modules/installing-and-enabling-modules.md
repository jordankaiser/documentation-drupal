# Installing and Enabling Modules

There are two ways of installing and enabling Drupal modules. One is through the Drupal interface and the other is to manually place the files into the proper installation directory.

## Installing a modules through the Admin interface

First make sure _Update Manager _ is turned on under the _Extend_ section of the Drupal CMS. This module allows you to install other modules through the admin interface is also helps keep you installed modules up to date.

Also this is a good visual representation of how modular drupal is. Practically all of the functionality is pulled in via a module listed on the _Extend_ page.
