# Users, Roles and Permissions

A user in this context is defined as anyone who visits your site, regardless of whether the have an account on the site. This is how Drupal controls what a user can do. A user without an account on the site can only view the rendered output \(site\) of Drupal. A user of Editor, for example, might only be able to add new content. A user of Admin would be able to add new fields and modify them, etc.

Administration of the Users, Roles and Permissions is done under the _People_ section of Drupal.

This seems a little self-explanatory if you're only want to do basic things. For more complex things you'd probably want to go through [more learning](https://drupalize.me/topic/users-roles-and-permissions).
