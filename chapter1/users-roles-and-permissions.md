# Users, Roles and Permissions

A user in this context is defined as anyone who visits your site, regardless of whether the have an account on the site. This is how Drupal controls what a user can do. A user without an account on the site can only view the rendered output \(site\) of Drupal. A user of Editor, for example, might only be able to add new content. A user of Admin would be able to add new fields and modify them, etc.

Administration of the Users, Roles and Permissions is done under the _People_ section of Drupal.
