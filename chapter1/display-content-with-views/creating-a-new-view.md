# Creating a new View

To create a new view to to _Structure &gt; Views &gt; Add View_. Under View Settings you'll get a drop-down for Show. This drop-down lists all the different types of Entities which can display Views. Choose the appropriate Type and sorting.

Then on Page Settings you can create a page that will house the content created by this view. Below that you can have this view by setup as a Block too. Setting it up as a block will allow the list of content created by this view to be usable whereever on the site. So you could put it in a sidebar for example.
