## Controlling HTML Markup with Views Style Settings

Drupal has default settings as to how the HTML will be structured for a view. You can override this on a particular Field in a view.

* Click on the Field title.
* Under Style Settings choose Custimize HTML.
* Here you can choose the wrapping DOM Element.
* You can also create a custom CSS class to attach.
* If you want to remove the default classes drupal adds you can uncheck _Add Default Classes_.
