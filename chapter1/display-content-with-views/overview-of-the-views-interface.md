## Overview of the Views User Interface

What's commonly refered to as Views is actually two modules, Views and Views UI. Views handles creating the customized list and queries from your database and Views UI is the admin interface for handling those lists. In Drupal 8 both the Views and Views UI modules come installed by default. Previous versions of Drupal do not include them by default.

To see the Views admin interface navigate to _Structure &gt; Views_. Here you can see the default list of Views included. Let's look at the Frontpage View as an example.

At the top we can see the Displays heading under which Page is selected. Page is the most common view in Drupal. It allows you to define a URL that lives on the Drupal site that lists content in a way that's viewable to a user.

Within the Displays section we can see the Format area which defines how the data will be formatted.

The Filter Criteria is where we filter what data we want included in this View. Sort criteria determines how the list will be ordered.

In the middle of the page are the Page Settings for the View. Here you can set various things such as, should the View appear in the Menu?, What is the path the view should live at \(URL\)?, do you want to include a Header/Footer? Also included are settings for the Pager which adds pagination.
