# Displaying Content & Fields with Views Format

Under _Structure &gt; Views &gt; Edit_ we're looking at the Format Section. Clicking Format you'll see a list of available formats, Grid, HTML List, Table and Unformatted. Unformatted is the most generic.

Setting the Format to Grid will display the content in a Grid like setting, sort of similar to a table but mimicing what a CSS grid setup could do. This is weird for a list of blog entries but seems more useful for callouts or something similar.

Additionally under the Format section you've got the Show settings. Here is you can set what information gets displayed in the view. Content, for example, will show the content of the selected Content type; fully if desired. You can also set it to Teaser so that it's only show a preview of the full content. Setting Show to Fields will pipe in the title instead of the full content.

When you set the _Format Show_ to _Fields_ you can pick individual fields within the content type to show.

Under the _Fields_ section is where you decide which of the fields get pulled into the view. When configuring a _field_ to be pulled in by a view there is a checkbox called _Exclude from display_. This can be a helpful option for custom theming.
