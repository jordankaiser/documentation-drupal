## Structure of a Theme

The root folder of a theme should be all lowercase and use underscores instead of spaces. There are two places a custom or contrib theme might be found.

* _Sites/\[site name\]/themes/\[theme name\]_
* _Themes/\[contrib/custom\]/\[theme name\]_

You would organized themes under _Sites_ in situations where you have a multisite Drupal install. Otherwise they can go under the _themes _folder.
