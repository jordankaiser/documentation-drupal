## What Are Template Files?

Templates are responsible for generating the HTML markup of a page. Drupal generates HTML by combining the output of multiple template files. For example the innermost templates might be responsible for outputing an image next to a blog teaser while the outermost template would have the closing/opening html tags as well as site-wide common elements like the header and footer.
