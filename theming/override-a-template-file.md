## Override a Template File

Drupals base templates will provide some default markup. What you want to do is locate those templates, copy them, then update/modify them as necessary.

* Locate the template you wish to override
  * This can be done by inspecting the element, with Twig debugging on it will point you toward the applied template.
* Copy the applied template to you custom them folder.
* Make your changes.
* Clear the cache then reload to see your changes.
