## Twig in Drupal

Twig is the templating engine in Drupal. It compiles down to PHP. Drupal version &lt; 8 do not use Twig as the templating engine, instead they use PHP.

```
// Syntax for printing
{{ say something }}

// Syntax for "doing" something like a loop or a true/false statement
{% do something %}

// Commenting
{# comment here #}

```
