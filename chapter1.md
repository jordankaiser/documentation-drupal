# Site Building

The concepts covered in this chapter revolve around getting a instance of Drupal running and configuring it's options to create a function site. Topics covered include creating content types, lists with View, menu and setting up roles and permissions.

Much or maybe all of the information in this chapter is about manipulating the Drupal CMS itself and not about writing any code at all.
